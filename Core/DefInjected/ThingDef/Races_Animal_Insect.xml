  <!-- EN: A genetically-engineered war insect that resembles a massive beetle. Once the worker caste of an artificial ecosystem of insects designed to fight mechanoid invasions, it is less deadly than its larger cousins. Still, its size and hard shell make it dangerous when it attacks. A eusocial creature, it cannot reproduce individually.\n\nEngineered to thrive in mechanoid-ravaged environments, war insects like this move faster after being exposed to polluted terrain. -->
